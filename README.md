# Cloud-Connected File Manager

# Introduction

Welcome to the README for the Cloud-Connected File Management project, a
crucial component of a broader Computer Architecture project. This project
revolves around the seamless uploading and downloading of files to and from
cloud storage. The aim is to provide an efficient solution that complements the
Assembly project's file management requirements.

# Purpose

1. Seamless Cloud Integration: 
    The project aims to bridge the gap between local file management and cloud
    storage. By developing a script that effortlessly uploads and downloads
    files to and from cloud storage, we aim to provide a streamlined experience
    for users.
1. Learning Opportunity: 
    This endeavor is not only about achieving technical goals but also about the
    journey of learning. The project serves as a platform for understanding the
    intricacies of cloud computing, storage systems, and their integration with
    different programming languages.

# Features

1. File Upload:
    Our script allows users to upload files to a designated cloud storage,
    ensuring data is securely stored and easily accessible.

1. Automated Downloads: 
    The project facilitates the seamless retrieval of new files from the cloud,
    enhancing the efficiency of data synchronization.

1. Educational Value:
    Beyond its practical applications, the project offers a valuable learning
    experience by delving into cloud technologies and their synergy with
    diverse programming languages.

# Usage

To employ the script effectively, follow these steps:

1. Upload: 
    Execute the script to upload files to the designated cloud storage.

1. Download:
    Implement the script to automatically download new files from the cloud to
    your local environment.

# Contributions

Contributions to this project are more than welcome. If you identify
opportunities for improvement, have suggestions, or wish to enhance the
existing codebase, feel free to submit your pull requests. Collaboration is key
to the project's growth and evolution.
